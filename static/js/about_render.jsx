                        For many, the idea of reading the news has 
                        become synonymous with becoming upset. 
                        So much so that some have given up on reading 
                        the news entirely to prevent these feelings.
                        <br/> <br/>
                        The goal behind News By Mood was to understand 
                        how news articles can elicit specific emotional 
                        responses within their readers and give 
                        these readers an “emotional profile” of the article 
                        beforehand. 
                        It also provides users with a "source personality" of 
                        each source found on the website, which 
                        is meant to be a snapshot of the kinds of 
                        tones found in articles written by that source. 
                        This is an effort to make more clear the subjective 
                        and objective tendencies of sources to write articles 
                        that make their readers feel a certain way, or how these 
                        sources present their data and conclusions 
                        (or lack thereof).

                        <u>How it works</u>   
                        <br />
                        News By Mood pulls in approximately 70 articles a day, 
                        across various news sources within the United States and abroad. 
                        These articles are web scraped for their content, which is then
                        processed by the sentimental analyzer to recognize the dominant 
                        emotional (anger, fear, joy, sadness) 
                        and language (analytical, confident, tentative) 
                        tones present in them. 
                        A user can then filter these articles by tone, or by 
                        the category of news they want to read. They can also 
                        evaluate the personality profiles of news sources 
                        to see what types of articles the source generally puts out.

                        <u>Future Ideas</u><br />
                        It will be interesting to see how different sources
                        rank based on their overall tone profiles. 
                        To make it more statistically significant, it would 
                        be useful to incorporate more news articles from multiple 
                        APIs, in order to provide a better, more 
                        well-rounded view of each source’s personality.

                        The approximations of the tone analyzer are not perfect. 
                        Aditionally, the website pulls in a small number of 
                        articles from each source, and is therefore only meant 
                        to be a snapshot of its personality and not entirely 
                        representative of all their work.

                            describes the tones returned from the linguistics 
                            analysis with the above definitions.
                            Each tone is returned with a score 
                            that ranges between 0 and 1. 
                            The closer to 1, the more dominant the score. 
                            All scores below 0.5 are excluded. 
                            Additionally, each tone is independent of one-another, 
                            and therefore, an article can have multiple 
                            emotional and language tones.
